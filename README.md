If run inside of a directory which contains the wav files for an album formatted as if they were downloaded from bandcamp.com, this script produces a full album youtube video with timestamps for each track.

You need python pydub for this, as python wave was having a hard time with wav files from bandcamp.

All of the file paths are written with linux in mind, so I would imagine you will have to make changes to run this on windows.
